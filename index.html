                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                    is a small and lightweight language. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside a host environment (for
                    example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                    its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                    and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                    structures, and statements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                    variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                    example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                    to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For example,
                        client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                        HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                        and page navigation. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                        relevant to running JavaScript on a server. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For example, server-side
                        extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                        provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                        the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                    in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                    Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                    constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                    JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                    class-based object model.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                    JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                    loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                    be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                    function return types are not explicitly typed.

            <header>Hello world</header>
            <article>
              To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
              first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
              <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>
              

              Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
              browser!

              <p>more code examples</p>
              <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
              However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
              is executed without problems.
              <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
              You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
              names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
              A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
              dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
              JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
              "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
              You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
              identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
              _name.
            </p>
            <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
